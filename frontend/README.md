## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Afrah3B/eduTrack.git
cd eduTrack/frontend
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables in `config.json`:

```text
{
    "EMAIL": "mailto:example@example.com",
    "WHATSUP": "https://wa.me/+966",
    "BASE_API": "http://localhost:5000/api/",
    "UPLOAD_API": "http://localhost:5000/"
}
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.
The page reloads automatically on changes.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

## üèó Architecture Overview

* **React**: Component-based UI
* **React Router**: Navigation between pages
* **Context & Hooks**: State management for auth, courses, and progress
* **Axios/Fetch**: API communication with backend
* **Jest + React Testing Library**: Testing components and flows

---

## üìå Assumptions & Considerations

* Frontend communicates with backend via `REACT_APP_API_URL`
* Users have roles (`student` or `instructor`) that determine UI access
* Lessons can contain multiple content types (text, video, PDF)
* Progress is tracked and displayed per student
* Config.json variables must be set before running
