# EduTrack Backend

## Overview
EduTrack is an online learning platform backend built with **Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma**.  
It supports user management, course creation, lesson tracking, enrollments, and student progress.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

- **Users & Authentication**
  - Student and Instructor signup
  - Student signin with JWT-based authentication
  - Role-based authorization middleware

- **Courses**
  - Create, update, soft delete courses (hard delete if no enrollments)
  - Instructors can only manage their own courses
  - List all courses

- **Lessons**
  - Add, update, delete lessons in a course
  - Lessons belong to specific courses
  - Lessons can contain both text and files
  - Only instructors of a course can modify lessons

- **Enrollments**
  - Students can enroll in courses
  - Track lesson completion (`EnrollmentLesson`)
  - Calculate student progress in a course
  - Instructors can view students enrolled in their courses

- **Testing**
  - Unit tests for controllers: auth, courses, lessons
  - Integration tests for key flows
  - Ensures proper handling of happy paths and forbidden access

## üèó Architecture Overview

* **Node.js + Express**: HTTP server, routing, middleware
* **PostgreSQL + Prisma**: Database and ORM
* **Redis**: Caching for frequently accessed data (courses, instructor courses)
* **Controllers**: Handle API logic
* **Models**: Prisma wrappers for database queries
* **Middlewares**: Authentication, role-based authorization
* **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests

---

## üìå Assumptions and Considerations

* Users have a `role` field (student or instructor) to enforce authorization
* Lessons can contain multiple content types (text, PDF, video)
* Courses can only be deleted if no students are enrolled (otherwise soft delete)
* Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data
* API responses follow a consistent JSON structure with proper status codes
* Integration tests require a test database with proper test users
* Sensitive environment variables must be configured before running the app

## üìÑ API Documentation

* All API endpoints are organized in Postman.
